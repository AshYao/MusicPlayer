# Title Font Size Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to increase the font sizes of titles in the Vue.js Music Player application, as requested: "タイトルのフォントサイズを大きくしたい" (I want to make the title font size larger).

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Application Title (Header h1)
- **Before:** Browser default font size (~16px)
- **After:** 48px with font-weight: 700
- **Improvement:** ~200% increase, making it the most prominent element

### 2. Current Song Title (h2.song-title)
- **Before:** 32px
- **After:** 42px
- **Improvement:** 31% increase for better visibility

### 3. Playlist Section Title (h3)
- **Before:** 32px
- **After:** 38px
- **Improvement:** 19% increase while maintaining hierarchy

## Responsive Design
Added responsive breakpoints to ensure titles display properly on all devices:

### Tablet (≤768px)
- Main title: 36px
- Song title: 32px
- Playlist title: 28px

### Mobile (≤480px)
- Main title: 28px
- Song title: 24px
- Playlist title: 22px

## Files Modified

### `/src/components/MusicPlayer.vue`
- Added explicit styling for `header h1` element
- Increased font-size for `.song-title` class
- Increased font-size for `.playlist h3` selector
- Added responsive media queries for mobile compatibility

## Visual Hierarchy
The new font sizes maintain a clear visual hierarchy:
1. **Main Application Title** (48px) - Primary brand element
2. **Current Song Title** (42px) - Main content focus
3. **Playlist Title** (38px) - Section identifier

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Run the development server: `npm run serve`
2. Open the application in a browser
3. Verify all titles are larger and more prominent
4. Test responsive behavior by resizing the browser window

### Visual Comparison
Open `/tests/visual-test.html` in a browser to see a side-by-side comparison of before and after font sizes.

### Unit Tests
Run the test suite: `npm test`
- Tests verify all title elements are present
- Tests confirm component functionality remains intact
- Tests validate proper CSS class structure

## Browser Compatibility
The changes use standard CSS properties and are compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Performance Impact
- No performance impact - only CSS changes
- No additional JavaScript or assets required
- Responsive design uses efficient media queries

## Future Considerations
- Font sizes can be easily adjusted by modifying the CSS values
- Additional breakpoints can be added for specific device sizes
- Font-weight and other typography properties can be fine-tuned as needed

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Removing the `header h1` CSS block
2. Changing `.song-title` font-size back to 32px
3. Changing `.playlist h3` font-size back to 32px
4. Removing the responsive media query blocks
